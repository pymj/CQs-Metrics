Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT  9 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION  
The Western Cape is a region of water scarcity; the average annual rainfall is only 515 mm. 
Most rainfall is during w inter, while the period October -March is the dry (and hot) season. For 
each dry season the municipality (City of Cape Town, CCT) may implement water restrictions 
aiming for up to  30% reduction of the consumption. Since 1997 the CCT uses an increasing 
block  tariff (IBT) structure for water pricing. More recently it implemented the national policy of a 
free provision of basic services, allowing for 6 kilolitres of free water per metered household. 
According to this policy, the setting of tariffs must ensure b oth the free water as well as a 
financially sustainable water supply for the municipality (PDG, 2001), with a budget for the water 
service set by the CCT.   
The delivery of services in urban areas is often more challenging in the formally settled or low -
income areas where most of the poor segment of the population lives. Service delivery in such 
areas is usually far below the minimum requirements of the resident population. These areas 
lack compliance with building codes and standards.   
1. WATER D EMAND  (CSIR , 2003)
Future water demand is one of the key issues in water supply planning. The following important 
points regarding the demographic and economic situations determining future water demand 
should correspond with the contents of the Water Services Devel opment Plan.  
The demographic and service information required includes:  
The current population;
The number of households;
The number of residential consumer units;
The incomes related to these consumer units;
The number and type of non -residential consu mer units;
Current levels of water service;
Current consumption; and
The demand of services, in terms of willingness to pay for the services desired.Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    10 The information required to make proper projections of future requirements includes:  
 
 Population grow th; 
 Economic growth;  
 Growth in number of consumer units;  
 Level of service provided to residential consumer units;  
 Changes in income levels  of residential consumer units;  
 Changes in consumption per consumer unit;  
 Effects of water -metering programmes; and  
 Weather patterns and climate  
1.1. Estimating Residential Water Demand in South Africa (Cape Town)  
 
1.1.1.  Background  
 
Stand size has been used to estimate residential water demand in South Africa since at least 
1979 ( Garlipp 1979  cited in Jacobs, Geustyn, Loubser & Van  Der Merwe , 2004, p. 2 ; CSIR 
1983  cited in Jacobs  et. el., 2004, p.2 ). At a later stage it was recognised that residential 
demand estimates should preferably be based on actual water use per town as recorded by the 
treasurer (City of Johannesburg 1989  cited in Jacobs  et. el., 2004, p.2 ). Guidelines for the 
estimation of demand base don stand size are however still widely used and promoted (Austin 
1995  cited in Jacobs et. el., 2004, p.2 ; CSIR 2003  cited in Jacobs et. el., 2004, p.2 ). A guideline 
based on sta nd size should only be used when more accurate methods are not available.  
 
Until recent years custom analysis of the data was required, in other words it was not possible 
to analyse the data programmatically feasible. Treasury systems contain a wealth of 
information, but closed database structures often obscure knowledge on the actual water 
demand required for analysis. The past decade has seen software developments that enable 
engineers to abstract and analyse water demand from treasury database. It has su bsequently 
become possible to abstract and analyse water information from treasury databases for 
selected municipalities who have employed these software tools. In this manner water demand 
could be modified more accurately. Results from such studies could also be used to construct 
guidelines for demand estimation based on stand size as a sole explanatory variable – a model 
with one explanatory variable, or independent variable, is termed a single coefficient model. 
Such guidelines can then be used in cases where more accurate methods are not affordable.  
 Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    11 1.1.2.  Guidelines for Residential Demand Estimation  
  
The construction of three guidelines curves and corresponding envelope curves are discussed 
separately for three geographic regions and two stand types. When s tand size is available as 
the sole explanatory variable these curves will provide a more accurate water demand estimate 
than those previously published. In each case the mathematical demand functions as well as 
the resulting curves are provided for practic al application.  
 
If it is assumed that Cape Town, Ekurhuleni and George represent the coastal winter rainfall 
region, inland summer rainfall region, and coastal annual rainfall region of the country 
respectively, the following guidelines for demand estimat ion can be constructed.  
 
 Coastal winter rainfall region  (Jacobs, et. el., 2004, p. 10 ) 
 
Guideline curve – coastal winter rainfall region  
 
Statistical analysis indicates that two linear equations, with separate slopes, best fit the data – 
instead of a singl e linear fit. The change in slope could be partly explained by considering the 
fact that no distinction could be made between townships and suburbs in the data sets of Cape 
Town. Cape Town, where township -type and suburb -type stands are combined in one dat asets, 
a different slope could be expected above a stand size of approximately 800 m².  
 
Two equations were calculated based on the least squares method for stand sizes 100 m² to 
800 m² and 800 m² to 2000 m². The R² values of 0,981 and 0,928 respectively f or the 
correlation between the linear equations and the data points are relatively high (a single linear fit 
was also constructed, but was discarded in favour of the former method, mainly due to the 
linear curve being less conservative for AADD estimates b etween stand sizes of 600 m²  and 
1200 m²). In order to construct a practical mathematical model over the entire stand range the 
intersection of the curves was calculated. The mathematical form of the guideline curve is 
presented in Figure 1.1  is:

Envelope curves – coastal winter rainfall region  
 
The upper boundary of the envelope is more critical than lower and was also split into two 
sections. The same two slopes as in E quation 1 were used, but the two equations w ere 
constructed to intersect the highest point of all the individual databases – that for Tygerberg at 
1100 m² with an AADD of 1,767 ( refer to F igure 1.2).

The lower envelope follows the slope of  the linear trend through the combined Cape Town data, 
but the intersect of the linear equation was moved down by visual inspection to originate just 
below the lowest point. The mathematical description of the envelope curve is:

HOUSING PROJECTS  
 
11.1. General  
The suitability of plumbing materials in low cost housing units has to be viewed from the 
perspe ctive of pricing, its water saving capabilities, durability and the risk of it being stolen for its 
scrap value.  
 
An important item, although not material related, is the location of water meters in low cost 
housing schemes. Often, where the meter is locat ed on lot, accessibility for reading purposes is 
compromised when occupants later erect high fences, for security reasons. The best position 
for the meter is outside the property, in an undercover  location on the footway  or vertically 
mounted  against the d welling very effective for low coat housing.   
 
11.2. Material  
It should also be borne in mind that all materials must comply with the relevant SA NS/JASWIC 
(Joint Acceptance Scheme for Water Installation Components) standards. This is a requirement 
of our Water Services by -law. However, provision has been made in the by -law for Council to 
use pipes, fittings and other plumbing components, which are not on the Jaswic list, should this 
be required in order to evaluate the suitability of new materials for spec ific applications.  
 
11.3. Pipes and piping systems for underground use in the supply of potable 
water.  
 
An important part in the installation of water pipes in underground locations  is the condition of 
the soil in which the pipe is to be laid. If it is con taminated with chemical substances, this could 
affect the durability of the pipe. It would also determine the material of which the pipe is 
manufactured. Popular piping systems are:  
11.3.1. Copper  
 
Copper pipe is historically the preferred material in the Cape Town region. It is available in 3 
classes, namely: class 0, class 1 and class 2. For underground use, only class is allowed, 
because of its thicker wall. Class 2 pipe is however, much more expensive than the other 2 
classes. Copper pipe should not be laid in soil that contains ash, salt and chemicals such as 
ammonia and magnesite. These substances will cause ‘pitting’ of the wall of the pipe.  
 Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    51 11.3.2. Polypropylene (polycop)  
      
This type of ‘plastic’ pipe is very popular for underground use. The Wat er Services Hillstar depot 
has been using it for the installation of new water connections, ranging in size from 20mm to 
50mm, since approximately 1992, and it has proven to be very reliable. The brass ‘Conex’ 
fittings could prove to be expensive, especial ly in the larger sizes. It should not be laid in soil 
that is contaminated with petrol, oil and a number of other chemicals. These chemicals 
permeate through the wall of the pipe, resulting in bad taste and smell in the drinking water. In 
such cases, the o nly solution is to replace the pipe with class 2 copper, since the smell and 
taste lingers and cannot be eliminated  from the plastic pipe. This condition affects all pipes and 
fittings manufactured from plastic polymers, and is therefore not only restricte d to polycop 
piping.   
 
For this reason, in the case of plans approval for a service station, we call for copper pipe to be 
used in both above ground and underground applications in the forecourt area, where invariably 
spills of oil/petrol will take place.  
 
It is imperative that only SA NS approved, class 16 polycop pipe is used. It has been found that 
the lighter class 12 pipe is not so durable.  
 
11.3.3. HDPE (high density polyethylene)  
 
This plastic pipe has also gained popularity for underground use. The ‘ plasson’ fittings are quite 
bulky. Personal experience has shown that with age, underground leaks tend to be problematic. 
This is found to be the case, when we have to process rebate claims for underground defects 
on private properties. It has also been fo und that moles have a special affinity for these pipes, 
and many an underground leak is due to a hole having been gnawed into the pipe. Chemical 
contamination in underground use also presents a problem.  
11.3.4. Other types of ‘plastic’ pipes  
 
There is a ho st of other ‘plastic’ pipes and pipe systems for potable water installation on the 
market. Of late, these include composite pipes, which combine layers of plastic and Aluminium  
to form a tube. The problems with many of these systems are that special tools are required to 
facilitate its installation, and that the fittings are not always readily available. Compatibility 
between different systems  is also a problem.  
 Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    52 11.3.5. Galvanised mild steel pipes  
 
It should be noted that in line with our Water services by -law, galvani sed mild steel pipes and 
fittings are not allowed to convey water supplied from the Municipality’s mains.  
 
This is because our water is only chemically stabilised for copper systems. It is also ‘soft’ and 
therefore aggressive in nature, and re acts with other metallic pipes, such as galvanised steel 
and Aluminium . In the case of G.I. pipes, serious encrustation forms on the inside of the pipes, 
thereby diminishing its bore. This eventually causes poor supply pressures and restricted flows 
from t erminal fittings.  
 
11.4. Pipes and piping systems for above ground use.  
 
According to the Red Book pipes may have to be above ground due adverse conditions, such 
as rock. When considering laying pipes above ground, the following factors need to be taken 
into account:  
 
 Provision should be made for expansion (the effects of thermal changes must be 
considered).  
 Each pipe section should be properly supported. The supports should be designed to carry 
the load of the pipe as well as the water it conveys. Suffici ent support should be included in 
order to prevent sagging of the pipeline. The pipe should be strapped to the support, leaving 
room for movement.  
 Adequate thrust blocks should be designed to cater for hydraulic forces at bends.  
 Adequate anchoring should b e provided, especially in steep slopes, and directional and 
elevation changes.  
 The consequences of pipe failure should be evaluated.  
 Heavy equipment like valves should be supported independently.  
 Adequate protection should be provided to cope with external  abrasion.  
 
11.4.1. Material used for piping system above ground  
 
All the previously mentioned pipes, except for galvanised mild steel pipes, can be used in above 
ground installations.  
However, in certain applications, additional conditions have to be met.  
 Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    53 11.4.1.1. Copper  
 
All 3 classes can be used above ground. Class 0 is an extremely hard, thin walled pipe, which 
should not be formed into ‘labour bends. Because of its hardness, compression fittings should 
also not be used. Any change of direction in the  piping system, should be achieved by the use 
of ‘copcal’ capillary soldered fittings. A full range of tee -pieces and bends, of various angles, is 
provided for this purpose. Class 1 pipe has a thicker wall than class 0, and is in turn thinner 
walled than c lass 2. Both classes 1 and 2 can be formed into ‘labour’ bends, which reduces the 
need for a fitting, saves time during installation and gives improved flow.  
 
Brazing (hard soldering) of copper pipes is not allowed. Although copper pipe systems are 
durabl e and very popular with plumbers, in above ground applications it is prone to theft.  This 
can be problematic in low cost housing, where we have experienced in certain instances that 
the occupants of the house have in fact removed brass and copper from the  plumbing system, 
to be sold as scrap.  
 
In its effort to avoid this type of behavior , the maintenance section of Housing Department is 
investigating the use of an ‘all plastic’ threaded type of piping system. Copper systems are also 
more expensive than co mparable plastic pipe installations. Some ‘plastic’ pipes have conditions 
imposed when used in hot water installations. Others are only compatible with cold water. None 
of the ‘plastic’ pipes in use at present is approved for use in fire and combined fire/ domestic 
installations in above ground locations, due to its combustibility. Should a pipe rupture during a 
fire, it would result in severe pressure loss, rendering the fire -fighting system ineffective. For this 
reason only copper and black steel piping ca n be used in above ground locations in fire -fighting 
installations.  
11.4.2. Taps and Stopcocks  
 
It is noted with concern that all the less expensive chrome plated taps for kitchen sinks and 
wash hand basins have spouts that cannot accommodate a water savin g aerator. This device is 
only catered for, on the more expensive models. An in -line flow controller, supplying less than 6 
litres per minute installed in the supply line to the tap, should solve this problem. This would 
also conform to the by -law’s requir ement that a basin tap should not discharge more than 6 
litres per minute.  
 
Ball valves (‘ballostops’) should be used in place of stopcocks, since they are less expensive 
and also have better flow characteristics . 
 Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    54 In the case of outside garden taps, a pla stic tap would be most suitable, since it doesn’t 
represent much in terms of scrap value. ‘Colour Taps’ has such a product on the market, but 
currently it is not JASWIC approved. Council can permit it to be installed, without JASWIC 
approval, as per the pr ovision of the by -law, but experience has shown that in normal use as a 
garden tap, it is not very durable.  
 
Perhaps, better location of a brass garden tap, would prevent theft.  
11.4.3. Water closet cisterns  
 
There are various models of w/c cisterns on the  market. One of the most suitable for low cost 
housing, is the 9 litre ‘Shires’ duranite unit. It is available for both “low level” and “high level” 
applications.  It is extremely rugged in construction and is fitted with a dual flush siphon  valve. 
This ty pe of flushing mechanism does not cause water to trickle (leak) into the pan when the 
system is not in use. This problem is normally experienced with the type of flushing valve that 
employs a flapper rubber to seal off the water at the bottom of the cister n.  
 
This leakage can be a tremendous source of wastage, since it normally carries on around the 
clock, until it is repaired. This type of wastage would normally go undetected in low cost housing 
units. Another one of this cistern’s positive features is a plastic float valve with an Aluminium  
arm. Brass float valve arms are normally removed and sold for its scrap value. The diaphragm 
fitted to the siphon normally lasts for more than 5 years before a replacement is required. With 
this type of cistern an exte rnal overflow pipe is installed. Any overflow of water from it due to a 
defective float valve would be readily discernible , whilst this will not be the case with a ‘flapper’ 
rubber type valve, which has an internal overflow, as an integral part.  
11.4.4. Hot water cylinders.  
 
If there were sufficient height for its installation, a copper tank combination (gravity feed) hot 
water cylinder would be the best option for low cost housing.  
 
This type of cylinder has a float valve, similar to the one installed in t he w/c cistern, and 
therefore its maintenance is minimal. However, because it is an ‘open to the atmosphere’ 
system, heat loss is experienced. This results in slightly higher electricity bills. This ‘open’ 
system places little strain on the inner tank, and  consequently this type of cylinder should last 
indefinitely. Where the plumbing design cannot accommodate a combination hot water cylinder, 
a pressurised system will have to be installed.  
 Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    55 The 100, 200 and 400 kPa copper tank  cylinders are the next best options. Some 400 and 600 
kPa units have galvanised steel inner tanks, and these require a sacrificial anode to protect it 
against the corrosive effects of the aggressive soft water, being supplied by Council. This anode 
has to be inspected regularly and r eplaced when this becomes necessary. This operation adds 
to the maintenance costs of the cylinder. With the copper tank cylinders, this is not required.  
 
The lower delivery pressure of the 100 and 200 kPa copper tank cylinders, also contributes to 
saving of water, since this equates to lower flow rates at terminal fittings. Both types of 
pressurised hot water cylinders require a pressure reducing valve, a pressure relief valve 
(sometimes the two are combined), a temperature and pressure safety valve and 2 vacuum 
breakers. This increases the installation and maintenance costs, when compared with the 
combination hot water cylinder.  
 
Due to pressure variations being exerted on the inner tank of a pressurised hot water cylinder, 
these units normally do not las t as long as a combination hot water cylinder. Galvanised tank 
cylinders have been known to rupture after only 2 years in service. Brazing can usually repair 
the copper tank cylinder, whilst a defective galvanised steel tank cylinder will have to be 
discar ded, if the tank has ruptured.

COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM  
 
14.1. WATER DEMAND  
 
The water demand figures adopted for design purposes should be based on a projected 
value, say 20 years hence. The figures given in the guidelines allow for rising standards 
of living, and are the actual figures anticipated for the year 2000 based on 2 per cent per 
annum compounded growth. The water demand figures given apply to townships with 
flush sanitation.  
 
The wa ter demand figures are given in Appendix F1: Table SW5.1 . Figures for special 
residential erven of area larger than 2 000 m2 are not given as these large erven occur 
rarely in new townships. Figures adopted by the designer for such erven should be 
based on  local conditions.  Where upper and lower limits are given, it is envisaged that 
the upper limit would generally apply to the high income level township, and the lower 
limit to the lower income level township. Designers should note that in adopted water 
demand figures for a specific, cognizance must be taken of local factors such as income 
level, climate and water charges when interpolating between the upper and lower limits 
provided in these guidelines.  
 
14.1.1. Hydraulic formulae  
 
For the purpose of calcul ating friction losses in pipelines any of the recognized hydraulic 
formulae may be used. Friction loss calculations must take into account the long -term 
conditions of the internal surface of the pipes, and the possible increase in friction loss 
due to the quality of the water conveyed.  Friction coefficients adopted and the motivation 
for their choice should accompany the design. Allowance should also be made for losses 
in specials, fittings and laying imperfections by increasing calculated friction loss by a 
nominal 7 ½ per cent.

Service Guidelines & Standards for Water and Sanitation Department CCT                                                    71 14.1.2. Peak factors  
 
To obtain the residual head in the reticulation at any point it is necessary to balance the 
network using instantaneous peak flows. The various types of development should first 
be converted to equivalent er ven (ee) according to the design annual average daily 
demand accepting as a basis for design that one ee has an annual average daily 
demand of 1 000 l. Using the ee thus obtained, the peak factor pertaining at any point in 
the network should be obtained fr om Appendix F: Table SW5.1 . The annual average 
daily demand multiplied by the peak factor gives the instantaneous peak flow.  
14.1.3. Fire-fighting requirements  
 
The provision of water for fire -fighting should comply with the requirements as described 
in SA NS 090 -1972: Code of Practise for Community Protection Against Fire, but with the 
deviations from the code as provided in Appendix F: Tables SW5.2  to this document.  
14.1.4. Residual pressures  
 
The reticulation should be designed such that the residual pres sure in the reticulation 
main at any point is within the limits given in Table 12.1. The residual pressures 
applicable during fire flow conditions are given in the paragraph above.

the erf not exceeding 50 m from the boundary adjacent to the main.  
14.1.5. Erf connection  
 
The commu nication pipes for erf connections for dwelling houses (Residential zone 1) 
should be sized according  to Table 13. 1 and Table 13. 2.

The communication pipe may be reduced to 13 mm m inimum actual interval diameter, 
provided the minimum head in the reticulation main at the take -off point for the erf 
connection under instantaneous peak demand is not less than 30 m.  For development 
other than dwelling units metered individually, the comm unication pipe should  be sized 
according to the specific demand.

15.1. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION  
Unlike conventional gravity systems which depend solely on gravity flows, vacuum 
sewer systems make use of a combination o f gravity and differential air pressure as the 
driving force that propels sewage through the sewer network. Vacuum sewer systems 
consist of three key components,  collective chambers , vacuum sewers and the vacuum 
station.  
 
 
Figure 1: Major components of vacuum sewer systems  
 
As constructed in Kosovo, toilets cubicles at each sanitation block are drained through 
160mm diameter uPVC pipes to an adjacent vacuum valve pit containing the collection 
chamber, sensor unit and an interfac e valve. Once a predetermined volume of sewage 
has accumulated in the collection chamber the pneumatically activated sensor unit 
prompts the opening of the interface valve which links the collection chamber to the 
vacuum sewer network. When the interface v alve opens, the sewage, followed by a 
short burst of air, is sucked into the vacuum sewers. Each input of energy, occurring as 
the each interface valve along the network opens, further propels the sewage along the 
vacuum sewer network, consisting of 90 to 160mm diameter pipes, until it reaches the 
vacuum station where it accumulates in vacuum vessels.  Vacuum pipe

negative pressure in the vacuum vessels and throughout the vacuum sewer network. 
The sewage that accumulates in the vacuum vessels is evacuated by sewage pumps 
and is conveyed to a sewer outfall where it joins an existing gravity sewer .

Vacuum sewerage has the advantage of enabling the use of conventional flush toilets 
without the  need for deep trenches, large diameter sewers, numerous access manholes 
and the need to always travel in straight lines, as is customary with waterborne 
sewerage. The use of reduced diameter pipelines and shallow trenches in Kosovo 
reduced the disruption caused retrofitting a sewer network in the informal settlement by 
minimizing the number of shacks that had to be moved to allow for construction. Due to 
the flat gradients, sandy soils and high water -tables in the area, the installation of a 
conventional g ravity sewer system would have used 160 mm diameter pipes installed at 
depths of up to 7m and incorporating three lift stations. As a result of the high transport 
velocities within the vacuum sewers, the risk of sewer blockages is reduced. Major leaks 
in the system are also immediately evident, as suction is lost in the system, making 
vacuum sewerage particularly useful in environmentally sensitive area.

A dis advantage of vacuum sewerage is that the system’s operation can be disrupted by 
a disruption in the power supply to the vacuum pump station and carelessness when 
using the toilets by flushing down foreign objects (e.g. Cutlery, stones, sticks, etc.) 
result ing in the vacuum pumps not being able to generate the negative pressure 
required for the system to operate. In addition to this the malfunctioning of an interface 
valve or sensor unit would result in the toilet units draining to the specific collection 
chamber being rendered unusable. Any air leaks, originating from either the interface 
valves or the vacuum sewer lines, will result a loss of pressure thus causing the vacuum 
pumps to run for extended periods of time
